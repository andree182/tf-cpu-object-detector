This is just a simple tiny code to detect objects in an input video using TensorFlow Lite.

It's largerly based on the Frigate code

https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/dev/frigate/detectors/plugins/cpu_tfl.py

combined with various bits and pieces. Also the cpu_model is taken from Frigate.

Due to that, MIT license shall be used for this code.
